# The build image is pinned by digest and matches the toolchain directive in
# go.mod, so a release is built with exactly the Go patch level CI tested and
# scanned. Dependabot proposes digest updates.
#
# The build stage runs on the builder's own platform and cross-compiles for the
# target one (Go needs no emulator for that, and the binary has no cgo), so the
# arm64 image costs a second compile instead of a compile under QEMU.
